/*
* Let's Imagine that JDK is the Bigger container, it contains 2 things which also contains all the other
things that we may need in writing and excuting our programme.
* The JDK contains The JRE and the some development tools like Javac.
* The JRE by its turn contains the JVM and some other libiraries and files.
*
* The JDK is the mother of all, it contains and come with everything, it is a software development that is used
    to develope the java applications, and it also contains many things like:
    Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the interpreter/loader (Java), the compiler (javac), an archiver
    (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed in Java.
    In summary it containes some development tools and the JRE to help excuting the programmes.
    *

* The JRE is part of the jdk and is only used to run the programmes without that part of developing

* The JVm can be considered the most importnat part to run any programme as it, it is also known as the
    the interpreter, and it is responsible for checking the instructions line by lines and catch any bugs.
