# Java_Assignment01
This repository contains the codes of the first assignment for the course "Database Systems" in my year two at The African Leadership University in Rwanda.


### Prompts is as the following:

- **Question 1** 
  Given a person's name, height and weight , 
  write a program that calculates the bmi of that person , do not ignore decimals. Keep in mind that the decimal points will be limited to 2. 
  And print everything beautifully . 
  Write another program that declares two integers defining the length and the width of a rectangle. You are requested to calculate both its perimeter and its surface area. In printing the perimeter and surface area of the rectangle,print the perimeter and the surface area of the rectangle as of the type short, int, long and double (with 4 decimal points). Concatenate the answer with a string specifying the data type and the actual value of the perimeter or the surface area. For example; 
  The perimeter of the rectangle using short data type is : 30 
  Points to consider while doing this question: 
  - Variable names should be reflecting what they are used for - Comments should show the intention of the line of code and whether you are using implicit or explicit casting.
